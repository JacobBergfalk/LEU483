***  Assignment 3b, text analyse ***

Your task is to make a small program that derives some statistics of the text
in a file.

The analysis shall contain the number of lines in the file, the number of words
and the percentage of different letters.

It is sufficient to just handle the English letters (a-z). Words such as
"can't" and "off-campus" shall be counted as single words. Numbers (e.g. 123)
shall not be counted as words. For simplicity, you can assume that there are no
strange words such as love2you, and that the characters ' and - only are
present in words.

The output shall look like this (where XXX.txt shall be the name of the file
analysed):

Text in XXX.txt has

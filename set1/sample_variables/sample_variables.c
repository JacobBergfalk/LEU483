/*
 *  This is basic about types, literals, variables
 *  and assignments.
 * 
 *  Types denotes sets of values. Initially we will use the types:
 *  - int, the set of integers
 *  - float, double, sets of real numbers
 *  - char, the set of characters (character codes)
 *
 *  A literal is a constant (hard coded) value in the code for example 354 or 'F'.
 *  Will newer change. A literal is classified to belong to some type
 *  - 354 will be an integer (only digits, possibly a sign).
 *  - 35.4 will be a double ( '.' is decimal separator).
 *  - 'F' will be a char (a character code), single quotes.
 *  - "354" will be a string (a text), double quotes.
 * 
 *  A variable is a alterable container for a specific type of value.
 *
 *  A variable declaration is when we specify the type of value and name of
 *  the variable. A variable must be declared before we use it.
 *  When declared we can use in the program.
 *
 *  Optionally we may initialize the variable at the declaration.
 *  This is done using an assignment operator (=)
